# smoke tests

Known bugs:
- "-1-2-3" on keyboard is rendered as "1 + -2 + -3"
- missing navigation button to (default) next level (at the end of the current level)
- level overview graph does not show edges
- CAS is still limited/buggy (decimal representation instead of symbolic terms, e.g. "1.57..." instead of "pi/2"; or "1/2+1" instead of "3/2"); known bugs are marked by "work-in-progess"-texts
- the context-sensitive keyboard for answers is too restricted in some cases (e.g. "pi" is missing, ...); especially polar form input is currently not available; known bugs are marked by "work-in-progess"-texts
- the TeX-engine is inaccurate in spacing
- the active input icon "<...>" (where the keyboard is bound to) needs a distinct color
- scoring is not persisted
